**aixyz** is the payment-native SDK for AI agents. Build agents and tools with your favorite framework, and get paid instantly through web3 payment rails — no payment integration work required.

> Build an agent and get paid today.

Every agent you deploy with aixyz comes with [x402 payments](/protocols/x402) embedded. When another agent or user calls yours, settlement happens on-chain automatically. You set a price, deploy, and start earning.

## How It Works

1. **Build your agent** — Use [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) (`ai@^6`) or any framework to create agents with tools
2. **Set your price** — Export an `accepts` object to gate endpoints with instant micropayments
3. **Deploy and earn** — Run `aixyz build` and deploy. Payments settle on-chain via [x402](https://www.x402.org/)

```typescript
// app/agent.ts — set your price and start earning
export const accepts: Accepts = {
  scheme: "exact",
  price: "$0.01",
};
```

aixyz auto-generates a server that exposes:

| Endpoint                       | Protocol | Description                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | A2A      | Agent discovery card                     |
| `/agent`                       | A2A      | JSON-RPC endpoint with x402 payment gate |
| `/mcp`                         | MCP      | Tool sharing with MCP clients            |

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx create-aixyz-app my-agent
cd my-agent
bun run dev
```

Your agent is running at `http://localhost:3000` with payments, [A2A](/protocols/a2a), and [MCP](/protocols/mcp) out of the box.
