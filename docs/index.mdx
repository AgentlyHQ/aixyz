**aixyz** is a framework for bundling AI agents into deployable services with built-in support for [A2A](/protocols/a2a), [MCP](/protocols/mcp), [x402 payments](/protocols/x402), and [ERC-8004 identity](/protocols/erc-8004).

Write your agent logic. aixyz handles protocol wiring, payment gating, and deployment.

## How It Works

1. **Define your agent** — Use [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) (`ai@^6`) to create agents with tools
2. **Configure identity and payments** — Set up `aixyz.config.ts` with agent metadata and x402 payment settings
3. **Deploy** — Run `aixyz build` and deploy to Vercel, Docker, or any Bun-compatible host

aixyz auto-generates a server that exposes:

| Endpoint                       | Protocol | Description                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | A2A      | Agent discovery card                     |
| `/agent`                       | A2A      | JSON-RPC endpoint with x402 payment gate |
| `/mcp`                         | MCP      | Tool sharing with MCP clients            |

## Quick Example

```bash
bunx create-aixyz-app my-agent
cd my-agent
bun run dev
```

Your agent is running at `http://localhost:3000` with A2A, MCP, and x402 payment support out of the box.
