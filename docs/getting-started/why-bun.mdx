## Why Bun?

aixyz uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its runtime and build tool. Here's why:

### All-in-One Toolchain

Bun provides a JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager in a single binary. This means no separate tools for building, testing, and running your agent:

```bash
bun install        # Package manager
bun run dev        # Runtime
bun run build      # Bundler
bun test           # Test runner
```

### Fast Startup and Execution

Bun starts significantly faster than Node.js, which matters for:

- **Development** — `aixyz dev` restarts on every file change with minimal delay
- **Serverless** — Cold starts on Vercel are faster with the Bun runtime
- **Testing** — `bun test` runs agent tests with near-instant startup

### Native TypeScript Support

Bun runs TypeScript directly without a compilation step. aixyz packages ship raw `.ts` files — Bun handles them natively.

### Built-in Test Runner

Bun includes a test runner compatible with Jest-like syntax (`describe`, `test`, `expect`). aixyz uses `bun:test` for agent testing:

```typescript
import { describe, expect, test } from "bun:test";
import { ToolLoopAgent } from "ai";
import agent from "./agent";

test("default export is a ToolLoopAgent", () => {
  expect(agent).toBeInstanceOf(ToolLoopAgent);
});
```

### Vercel Bun Runtime

Vercel supports Bun as a [serverless function runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/bun). aixyz agents deploy to Vercel with the Bun runtime out of the box — just set `bunVersion` in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "bun run build",
  "bunVersion": "1.x"
}
```

## Requirements

- **Bun 1.3.9** or later

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Verify version
bun --version
```
