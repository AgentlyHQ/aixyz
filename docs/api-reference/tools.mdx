description: "Auto-discovered tool definitions for A2A and MCP"

Each `.ts` file in `app/tools/` is auto-discovered and registered as a tool on both A2A and MCP endpoints.

```typescript
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { Accepts } from "aixyz/accepts";

export const accepts: Accepts = {
  scheme: "exact",
  price: "$0.0001",
};

export default tool({
  description: "Get current weather conditions for a city.",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("City name"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => {
    // your implementation
  },
});
```

## Exports

| Export    | Type      | Required | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `default` | `tool()`  | Yes      | The tool instance                             |
| `accepts` | `Accepts` | No       | Payment config — gates the tool on MCP `/mcp` |

## Conventions

- **Auto-discovered** — All `.ts` files in `app/tools/` are registered automatically
- **Ignored files** — Files starting with `_` (e.g., `_helpers.ts`) are skipped
- **Naming** — The tool is registered with the filename as its name (e.g., `weather.ts` → `weather`)
