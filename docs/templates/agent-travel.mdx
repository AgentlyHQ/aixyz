## Overview

The travel agent finds the cheapest flights between airports worldwide using real-time pricing data from the Skyscanner API. It demonstrates a custom server setup with dual payment support — both x402 crypto micropayments and Stripe for traditional payments.

## Configuration

```typescript
const config: AixyzConfig = {
  name: "Travel Agent - Flight Search",
  description:
    "AI agent that finds the cheapest flights between multiple departure airports and destinations worldwide",
  version: "1.0.0",
  x402: {
    payTo: process.env.X402_PAY_TO || "0xYourX402WalletAddress",
    network: process.env.X402_NETWORK || "eip155:84532",
  },
};
```

## Key Features

- **Multiple departure airports** — Compare prices from several origin airports
- **Worldwide destinations** — Search flights to any destination
- **Real-time pricing** — Live data from Skyscanner API
- **Dual payments** — Supports both x402 crypto and Stripe
- **Custom server** — Uses `app/server.ts` for manual endpoint control

## Payment
