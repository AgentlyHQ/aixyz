## Overview

The `@aixyz/stripe` package provides an experimental Stripe payment adapter for aixyz agents. It offers an alternative payment method alongside the default x402 protocol.

<Warning>
  This package is **experimental** and its API may change significantly in future releases. Use in production at your
  own risk.
</Warning>

## Status

The Stripe adapter is in early development. It aims to provide:

- Stripe Checkout integration for agent endpoints
- Per-request and subscription-based billing models
- Webhook handling for payment verification

## Installation

```bash
bun add @aixyz/stripe
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { StripeAdapter } from "@aixyz/stripe";

const stripe = new StripeAdapter({
  secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!,
});
```

## Relationship to x402

The x402 protocol is the primary payment mechanism in aixyz, built into the server at the framework level. The Stripe adapter is a supplementary option for teams that prefer traditional payment processing over crypto-native x402 payments.
