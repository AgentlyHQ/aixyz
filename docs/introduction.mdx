**Bundle AI agents into deployable services with built-in protocols and payments.**

Write your agent. aixyz wires up A2A, MCP, x402 payments, and ERC-8004 identity.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx create-aixyz-app my-agent
cd my-agent
bun run dev
```

Your agent is running at `http://localhost:3000`:

| Endpoint                       | Protocol | Description                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | A2A      | Agent discovery card                 |
| `/agent`                       | A2A      | JSON-RPC endpoint, x402 payment gate |
| `/mcp`                         | MCP      | Tool sharing with MCP clients        |
