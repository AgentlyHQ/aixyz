# Deployment

Learn how to deploy your ai-xyz.dev agent to production.

## Vercel Deployment

ai-xyz.dev agents are optimized for deployment on Vercel.

### Prerequisites

- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) (optional)

### Deploy via Git

The easiest way to deploy is to connect your GitHub repository to Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js configuration
5. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will:

- Install dependencies
- Build your agent
- Deploy to a production URL

### Deploy via CLI

You can also deploy using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables

Configure environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your project settings on Vercel
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add your variables:
   - `X402_PAY_TO` - Your payment recipient address
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI)
   - Any other secrets your agent needs

### Build Configuration

The `vercel.json` at the repository root configures the build:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd website && bun run build",
  "outputDirectory": "website/.next",
  "devCommand": "cd website && bun run dev",
  "installCommand": "bun install",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

For agent deployments, use the aixyz CLI build command:

```bash
aixyz-cli build
```

This generates Vercel Build Output API v3 structure in `.vercel/output/`.

## Other Platforms

While Vercel is recommended, you can deploy to any platform that supports:

- Node.js
- Serverless functions
- Static site hosting

### Docker

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1.3.9 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lock ./
RUN bun install
COPY . .
RUN bun run build

FROM oven/bun:1.3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "run", "start"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-agent .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-agent
```

### Railway

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Railway will auto-detect Next.js
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### Fly.io

1. Install flyctl
2. Run `fly launch`
3. Configure environment variables with `fly secrets set`
4. Deploy with `fly deploy`

## Custom Domain

### Vercel

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed

### SSL/TLS

Vercel automatically provides SSL certificates for all deployments.

## Monitoring

Monitor your deployed agent:

- **Vercel Analytics** - Built-in analytics and performance monitoring
- **Logs** - View real-time logs in the Vercel dashboard
- **Error Tracking** - Integrate with Sentry or similar services

## CI/CD

Vercel provides automatic deployments:

- **Production** - Deploys from your main branch
- **Preview** - Deploys for every pull request
- **Automatic** - No configuration needed
