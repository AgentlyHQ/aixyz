Remote job search agent powered by the Jobicy API.

**Source:** [`examples/agent-job-hunter`](https://github.com/AgentlyHQ/aixyz/tree/main/examples/agent-job-hunter)

## What It Does

An AI agent that searches for remote job opportunities worldwide using the Jobicy API. Users can search by country or region and get back job listings with titles, companies, industries, and links.

## Structure

```
agent-job-hunter/
  aixyz.config.ts       # Agent identity and payment config
  app/
    agent.ts            # ToolLoopAgent with gpt-4o-mini
    tools/
      search.ts         # Jobicy API job search
    icon.png            # Agent icon
  erc-8004.json         # ERC-8004 registration metadata
```

## Key Features

- **Jobicy API** — searches remote job listings by geography
- **No API key required** — Jobicy's public API
- **ERC-8004 metadata** — includes registration JSON for on-chain identity
- **x402 payments** — agent and tool priced at `$0.01`

## How the Tool Works

The search tool:

1. Takes a `geo` parameter (country or region)
2. Queries the Jobicy API for remote jobs in that location
3. Returns job listings with: title, company, industry, geography, job level, and publication date
